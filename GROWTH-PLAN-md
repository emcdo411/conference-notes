# Growth & Funding Roadmap

## Non-Dilutive Capital First
- Focus: Grants under $100K (HubZone, Blackouth EBS, BBRC)
- Rationale: Grow without giving up equity too early

## Scale Trajectory
- Serve 200 → 1,200 clients/month over 4 years (18x growth)
- Growth multiplier: 3–4x annually

## Investor Advantage
- High-leverage, low-risk growth
- Dilution minimized through grants-first approach
- Strong scaling framework (execution roadmap + brand authority)
