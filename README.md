✨ Now your README has:
1. **Badges** (professional look).
2. **Clickable TOC**.
3. **Advanced diagram**.
4. **Folder structure** for clarity.

Would you like me to also **write stubs** for the supporting files (`VISION.md`, `GROWTH_PLAN.md`, etc.) so Jason sees *real content* in each one instead of just placeholders?
